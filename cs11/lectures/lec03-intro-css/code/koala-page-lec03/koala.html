          Koalas are great. They have fluffy ears and are like teddy bears, only they come
          with a heart &lt;3.

          Koalas live in Australia. They are actually more closely related to the kangaroo than
          bears (they have pouches!). They eat a lot of Eucalyptus plants. They were discovered
          by Europeans over 200 years ago, and there are records of them being called names like
          "koolewong", "colo", "koolah", and "boorabee."
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, koalas have one of the smallest brains in porportion to their body
          weight. They usually live a solitary life in trees, sleeping up to 18 hours a day.
