Q: Where to get feedback/help after the class has ended?

Q: What languages did you know when you applied for internship/job? What were your level of
  competency with each?

Q: What books/resource to practice coding interview?
- CodeStepByStep
- Hackathons
- CodinGame (here's a good one on Promises for example): https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/347/javascript-promises-mastering-the-asynchronous/your-first-code-with-promises
- Hackerrank ("<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit" target="_blank">Interview Preparation Kit</a>")
- Practice on the whiteboard often, and practice explaining your code/problem-solving process with others. Use visuals.



Q: What's the best/most satisfying full-stack/programming project you've done?
- Working on CodeStepByStep was very cool
- Much of the material I've created in CSE154. It's easy to over-scope, but it is very rewarding to
be able to have an idea and see ways to incorporate the fullstack throughout.
- Protein visualizer
- Working at Expedia was pretty cool too, especially seeing the many different layers that goes into
a development project (programming is only a fraction, there's a lot that goes into code review process,
learning, user testing, etc.).


Q: What CSE/INFO classes do you recommend taking after CSE 154 that dives deeper
  into backend programming?
