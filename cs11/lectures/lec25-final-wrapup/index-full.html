          <h3>General Exam Tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Breathe. You're here to learn. You've successfully completed the CPs, HWs, and 
              section problems, and it's just a matter of applying what you've learned to 
              different problems!
            </li>
            <li>
              Practice early and consistently so you don't cram the day before!
              </p>
              <p>
              With that, it's perhaps most important to get at least 7 hours of sleep the night before to 
              be able to have a sharp mind when the time comes to solve new problems with familiar topics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Work on practice exams on paper, not your computer</strong>. 
            </li>
            <li>Review your Midterm and HW assignments!</li>

            on a terminal to log into your student webspace with your uwnetid and password. Most students
            find an SFTP client easiest to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of writing these slides, UW students will need to use <span class="monospace">vergil</span>

            <h2>Method 1: Using FileZilla to Transfer Local Files to your Student Web Space</h2>
            <p>
              FileZilla is a free program for Mac, Windows, and Linux which
              will allow you to easily upload and transfer local files to the internet.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>1. Installing and Starting FileZilla</h2>
            <p>
              First, install <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>
              (choose the <strong>Download FileZilla Client</strong> option, not the server option).
            </p>
            <p>
              Once installed, start the application. You should see something like this when it loads:
            </p>
            <p><a href="img/filezilla.png" target="_blank"><img class="center-slide-image width-60"
                                                                src="img/filezilla.png"

              Use the information provided on the
              <a href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/web-publishing/shared-hosting/sftp/">Generic Connect Settings</a>
              page to connect to your student webspace (vergil) in FileZilla:

            <p>
              Once you have connected successfully, you will see a directory structure on the right
              column of FileZilla:
            </p>

              The left (with a "Local site" dropdown) shows all of your files on your local
              computer, and the right (with a "Remote site" dropdown) shows all of your files
              on your student webspace.

          <section>
            <h2>3. Transferring Your Files Using FileZilla</h2>
            <p>
              To publish files to your public student url, simply drag and
              drop folders/files from local to remote.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure any files you want to be accessible by
              the public are put in the public_html folder - if you are also an employee of UW (e.g.
              a TA) you can activate both Student Web Publishing and the employee Web Publishing
              services, but you'll then use student_html for your student webspace and public_html
              for your employee one (more information on the
              differences between these two folders
              <a href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/web-publishing/shared-hosting/your-public_html-and-student_html-folders/">here</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Check that your files are now accessible by going to:</p>
            <p class="centered-text">
            <span class="monospace">https://students.washington.edu/netid</span></p>
            <p>replacing "netid" with your UW student netid. For example, my website is accessible at
            </p>
            <p class="centered-text">
            <a class="monospace" href="https://students.washington.edu/medskm">
              https://students.washington.edu/medskm</a>
            </p>
            <p>Note that for any server-side code (e.g. PHP) you don't need to do anything to run it!
            It works as soon as you upload it to the shared web hosting space.</p>

          <section id="ssh">
            <h2>Method 2: Using ssh to Access your Student Web Space</h2>
            <p>Secure Shell (SSH) allows a user to connect to a server remotely and open up a
            command-line terminal to run commands, scripts, or edit files. If you know how to use a
            terminal, this tends to be faster than SFTP (and is overall a good tool to know).
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>1. Connecting with SSH on the Command Line</h3>
            <p><strong>If on Windows without Bash (Windows 10):</strong> You'll need to install
            a terminal that allows you to ssh (e.g. <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>). Then
            follow the same instructions as below.
            </p>
            <p>In a terminal window, run the following command to connect to a server via SSH,
            replacing "netid" with your UW netid:</p>
            <pre><code class="no-syntax-highlight">ssh netid@vergil.u.washington.edu</code></pre>
            <p>Example of logging into SSH (use CTRL+D to quit session):</p>
            <p>
            <a href="img/ssh-demo.png" target="_blank"><img class="center-slide-image"
                                                            src="img/ssh-demo.png" alt="ssh demo" /></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Use <code>ls</code> to list your files in the current directory (note you no longer
              are in the local directory when in an ssh session) and <code>cd</code> to change
              directory (anything you edit in the public_html folder will be seen immediately
              on your public student website)
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>1. Connecting with SSH on the Command Line (Continued)</h3>
            <p>
              Tip: I have a bash alias for ssh-ing into different servers. To do this on your own
              computer, add the following line as an alias:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img class="center-slide-image full-width" src="img/bashrc.png" alt="bashrc alias for ssh" />
            </p>
            <p>
              You can then just type <code>vergil</code> in the terminal to ssh quickly. Here is a
              starting <a href="code/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a> file if you don't have one,
              with the alias command included on line 135 (among a few other aliases you may find
              helpful). You can create/edit your .bashrc which should be located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>2. Transferring Files with SCP on the Command Line: Local to Remote</h3>
            <p>
              SSH lets you log into the student server and navigate/edit files from the terminal.
              However, you cannot access your local files while in an ssh session.
            </p>
            <p>
              To transfer files from your local computer to the server, use the <a
                          href="https://haydenjames.io/linux-securely-copy-files-using-scp/">scp</a> (secure copy) command on the
              command line:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="no-syntax-highlight">scp sourcefile netid@vergil.u.washington.edu:destination</code></pre>
            <p class="code-caption">Command Line (local)</p>
            <p>
              The first argument is the path of the file you want to transfer relative to what
              current directory you are in - destination is the location on the server that you want to
              transfer the sourcefile to (use . for destination to transfer to the home directory, which
              is where you go each time you ssh into the server).
            </p>
            <p>To transfer an entire folder to the server, add <span class="monospace">-r</span>
            after <span class="monospace">scp</span> and replace <span class="monospace">sourcefile</span>
            with the folder name.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h3>2. Transferring Files with SCP on the Command Line: Remote to Local</h3>
            <p>
              If you know the path of a file/folder in your student website and want to transfer it
              to your local computer, just swap the argument order:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="no-syntax-highlight">scp netid@vergil.u.washington.edu:sourcepath .</code></pre>
            <p class="code-caption">Command Line (local)</p>
            <p>
              In this case, since your local directory system, the last <code>.</code> results in
              copying the file(s) located at sourcepath (on vergil) to the current directory.

          <h2>Student Websites</h2>
          <p>Q: What are some ideas to use my creative project/portfolio work after finals?</p>
          <p>Over the quarter, you've had 5 CP's exploring the "full stack" of web technologies - consider
          writing a brief reflection for each, discussing what you learned, your design process (and how that changed as you gained more experience), and what you would like to do if you were to
          continue a project.</p>
          <p>You can add to your student webspace anything written the languages we've learned this quarter,
          including projects in HTML/CSS, JS, PHP, SQL, etc.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Why set up your own website?</h2>
          <p>You can stand out among a sea of applicants for jobs with an online resume/portfolio</p>
          <p>You can show off your web programming work to friends, family, and even future
          employers! Also it's free while you're a UW student :)</p>
          <p>You can have a public repository of class/side projects you've done throughout
          college</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Side web dev projects, art/design, blog, photo albums, etc.</li>
            <li>Hackathon projects</li>
            <li><strong>Note: You may not publish any HW solutions beyond HW1 online</strong> (we
              included the creative projects so that you can have something you <em>can</em> publish by
              the end of the quarter)</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Online Portfoli/Resume Tips</h2>
          <p>
            You all have enough experience in the different languages we've covered to add these to
            your resume</p>
          <p>You all have enough experience to apply for web programming internships or project
          "contracts"</p>
          <p>As a web developer, you now have a lot of tools in your toolset to support your
          resume</p>

          <h3>Things to Consider When Applying for a Web Development Role</h3>
          <p>What area do you feel more comfortable with? Do you see yourself working ~8 hours a day
          writing/debugging front-end code? Back-end code? Both?
          </p>
          <p>Remember to list your skills such that you'd be confident talking about them to a
          potential employer during an interview</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Skills to Continue Developing</h2>
          <p>Some particularly helpful skills/experience to have today include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using public APIs in creative/useful ways</li>
            <li>Writing/documenting your own API</li>
            <li>Proficiency in SQL</li>
            <li>Client-side and server-side input validation (shows you're user-focused and can
              think ahead about edge cases)</li>
            <li>Any web tools that demonstrate an interest in solving problems using what you know
              (e.g. a calculator for a specific domain of problems, a website that allows users to
              play/solve puzzles, a todo-list application for users where they can log with a
              username and password)
            </li>
            <li>Various JS libraries/frameworks (Node.js, React, Backbone.js, Rx.js, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
<section>
          <h2>Building/Extending Your Website - What Should You Include?</h2>
          <p>
            It depends. Think about the purpose of your website - do you want a simple landing
            page? An online resume? A portfolio of different projects you've worked on? A blog?
          </p>
          <p>A good "general-purpose" website can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overview page/About Me page
            </li>
            <li>Academic background and current/post-graduation goals</li>
            <li>Professional/Work experience
              <ul>
                <li>Internships, part-time jobs, research, volunteering, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Blog
              <ul>
                <li>Life as a college student</li>
                <li>RSO blog</li>
                <li>Cooking/Travel/Seattle/etc.</li>

            <h3>Tips for Applying for Web Development Internships/Projects</h3>
            <p>Q: I’d love to get some sort of job/internship in web development. How do I use my skills that I’ve learned here to get employed?</p>
            </p>
            <p>Q: What can I put on an online resume after this course, and what should I focus on learning more about?</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Online Resume Tips</h2>
            <p>
              You all have enough experience in the different languages we've covered to add these to
              your resume and apply for internships, side projects, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a web developer, you now have a lot of tools in your toolset to support your
              resume, but expect to learn more
            </p>
            <p>Look at other resumes and portfolios for web developers. How do they showcase their projects? What were their first internship/job/research experiences? How do they talk about their
            hard/soft skills?</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Finding Internships/Projects</h2>
            <p>
              Web development is probably one of the most useful things to apply to a variety of projects. You can look for internships, as well as research groups on campus looking for website
              development.
            </p>
            <p>Networking is one of the most useful things to invest in. Check out some really cool <a href="https://www.meetup.com/find/tech/" target="_blank">meetups</a> in Seattle - for most of these, you don't need to be an expert, and can get connected to
            people who know about local opportunities.</p>
