            You'll need either an SFTP client (<a href="filezilla-project.org" target="_blank">FileZilla</a> is a good one) or

            on a terminal to log into your student webspace with your uwnetid and password. Most students
            find an SFTP client easiest to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of writing these slides, UW students will need to use <span class="monospace">vergil</span>
            as the server name for logging into your website.

            <h2>Method 1: Using FileZilla to Transfer Local Files to your Student Web Space</h2>
            <p>
              FileZilla is a free program for Mac, Windows, and Linux which
              will allow you to easily upload and transfer local files to the internet.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>1. Installing and Starting FileZilla</h2>
            <p>
              First, install <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>
              (choose the <strong>Download FileZilla Client</strong> option, not the server option).
            </p>
            <p>
              Once installed, start the application. You should see something like this when it loads:
            </p>
            <p><a href="img/filezilla.png" target="_blank"><img class="centered-figure two-thirds-width"
                                                                src="img/filezilla.png"
                                                                alt="filezilla" /></a></p>

              The left (with a "Local site" dropdown) shows all of your files on your local
              computer, and the right (with a "Remote site" dropdown) shows all of your files
              on your student webspace.

            <h2>3. Transferring Your Files Using FileZilla</h2>
            <p>
              To publish files to your public student url, simply drag and
              drop folders/files from local to remote.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure any files you want to be accessible by
              the public are put in the public_html folder - if you are also an employee of UW (e.g.
              a TA) you can activate both Student Web Publishing and the employee Web Publishing
              services, but you'll then use student_html for your student webspace and public_html
              for your employee one (more information on the
              differences between these two folders
              <a href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/web-publishing/shared-hosting/your-public_html-and-student_html-folders/">here</a>).
            </p>
            <p>Check that your files are now accessible by going to:</p>

            <span class="monospace">https://students.washington.edu/netid</span></p>

            <h2>Method 2: Using ssh to Access your Student Web Space</h2>
            <p>Secure Shell (SSH) allows a user to connect to a server remotely and open up a
            command-line terminal to run commands, scripts, or edit files. If you know how to use a
            terminal, this tends to be faster than SFTP (and is overall a good tool to know).
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>1. Connecting with SSH on the Command Line</h3>
            <p><strong>If on Windows without Bash (Windows 10):</strong> You'll need to install
            a terminal that allows you to ssh (e.g. <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>). Then
            follow the same instructions as below.
            </p>
            <p>In a terminal window, run the following command to connect to a server via SSH,
            replacing "netid" with your UW netid:</p>
            <pre><code class="no-syntax-highlight">ssh netid@vergil.u.washington.edu</code></pre>
            <p>Example of logging into SSH (use CTRL+D to quit session):</p>
            <p>
            <a href="img/ssh-demo.png" target="_blank"><img class="center-slide-image"
                                                            src="img/ssh-demo.png" alt="ssh demo" /></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Use <code>ls</code> to list your files in the current directory (note you no longer
              are in the local directory when in an ssh session) and <code>cd</code> to change
              directory (anything you edit in the public_html folder will be seen immediately
              on your public student website)
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>1. Connecting with SSH on the Command Line (Continued)</h3>
            <p>
              Tip: I have a bash alias for ssh-ing into different servers. To do this on your own
              computer, add the following line as an alias:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img class="center-slide-image full-width" src="img/bashrc.png" alt="bashrc alias for ssh" />
            </p>
            <p>
              You can then just type <code>vergil</code> in the terminal to ssh quickly. Here is a
              starting <a href="code/.bashrc"><code>.bashrc</code></a> file if you don't have one,
              with the alias command included on line 135 (among a few other aliases you may find
              helpful). You can create/edit your .bashrc which should be located at <code>~/.bashrc</code>.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>2. Transferring Files with SCP on the Command Line: Local to Remote</h3>
            <p>
              SSH lets you log into the student server and navigate/edit files from the terminal.
              However, you cannot access your local files while in an ssh session.

            <p>
              To transfer files from your local computer to the server, use the <a
                          href="https://haydenjames.io/linux-securely-copy-files-using-scp/">scp</a> (secure copy) command on the
              command line:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="no-syntax-highlight">scp sourcefile netid@vergil.u.washington.edu:destination</code></pre>
            <p class="code-caption">Command Line (local)</p>
            <p>
              The first argument is the path of the file you want to transfer relative to what
              current directory you are in - destination is the location on the server that you want to
              transfer the sourcefile to (use . for destination to transfer to the home directory, which
              is where you go each time you ssh into the server).
            </p>
            <p>To transfer an entire folder to the server, add <span class="monospace">-r</span>
            after <span class="monospace">scp</span> and replace <span class="monospace">sourcefile</span>
            with the folder name.

            <h3>2. Transferring Files with SCP on the Command Line: Remote to Local</h3>
            <p>
              If you know the path of a file/folder in your student website and want to transfer it
              to your local computer, just swap the argument order:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="no-syntax-highlight">scp netid@vergil.u.washington.edu:sourcepath .</code></pre>
            <p class="code-caption">Command Line (local)</p>
            <p>
              In this case, since your local directory system, the last <code>.</code> results in
              copying the file(s) located at sourcepath (on vergil) to the current directory.

            <p>With an online resume/portfolio, you can stand out among a sea of applicants for jobs/internships</p>
            <p>You can show off your web programming work to friends, family, and even future
            employers! Also it's free while you're a UW student :)</p>
            <p>You can have a public repository of class/side projects you've done throughout
            college</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Side web dev projects, art/design, blog, photo albums, etc.</li>
              <li>Hackathon projects</li>
            <li><strong>Note: You may not publish any assignment solutions online</strong> (we
            included the creative projects and Final Project so that you can have something you <em>can</em> publish by

          <h3>Building your Website - What Should You Include?</h3>
          <p>
            It depends. Think about the purpose of your website - do you want a simple landing
            page? An online resume? A portfolio of different projects you've worked on? A blog?
          </p>
          <p>A good "general-purpose" website can include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overview page/About Me page
            </li>
            <li>Academic background and current/post-graduation goals</li>
            <li>Professional/Work experience
              <ul>
                <li>Internships, part-time jobs, research, volunteering, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Blog
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Look at other resumes and portfolios for web developers. How do they showcase their projects? What were their first internship/job/research experiences? How do they talk about their
            hard/soft skills?</p>

            <h3>Applying for Web Development Internships/Projects</h3>
            <p>Q: I’d love to get some sort of job/internship in web development. How do I use my skills that I’ve learned here to get employed?</p>
            <ul>
          <li>First, think about what area you enjoy the most. Do you see yourself working ~8 hours a day
          writing/debugging front-end code? Back-end code? Both? UX and Design?
          <li>Are you interested in industry? Entrepreneurship? Research? Teaching? RSO's?</li>
          <li>Do you want to learn new things, or do you want to work on something you're comfortable with?</li>
          <li>TAing (ask if you'd like to learn more)!</li>

          <h3>Q: What languages did you know when you applied for internship/job? What were your level of
            competency with each?
          </h3>
            <p>
              First internship: product copywriter at Seattle e-commerce
              startup
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>10 weeks of Java, but learned other important skills like SEO, web design, etc.</li>
              <li>Did another copywriting job at a tech marketing agency later, and got involved in a few web development projects for clients.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              First software development internship was at Expedia
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>About 2 years of Java, HTML/CSS/JS/PHP background with a few other languages from coursework (C, Racket, Ruby, etc.).
            <li>
              Learned Java MVC and Backbone/Angular.js frameworks and various JS libraries (no prior experience)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Advice:</strong> Focus on your strengths and interests, and remember that internships are much more than just coding. You're there to learn, and this is probably one
            of the most useful classes you'll have taken to "learn how to learn" multiple languages in a short amount of time (with good habits).

          <h3>Q: What's the best/most satisfying full-stack/programming project you've done?</h3>
          <p>Projects that involved a lot of learning and exploration with a real-world application I was interested in.</p>
          <p>Educational technology:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Practice-It/CodeStepByStep has been one of my favorites
            </li>
            <li>Material created in CSE154 - always important to keep relevant, while staying true to the fundamentals of the client/server relationship.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Research/Computational biology
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interactive Protein visualizer (demo) - connected web development to early interests in genetics and educational technology</p>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Industry
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building public-facing and internal tools at Expedia was pretty cool too, especially seeing the many different layers that goes into
            a development project (programming is only a fraction, there's a lot that goes into code review process, user testing, etc.).

          <h3>Q: What are some ways to stay up-to-date with the latest web dev tools and trends?</h3>
          <p><strong>Pro-tip: Don't try and learn it all :)</strong></p>
          <p>Follow a couple of blogs/feeds and stay up to day with 1-2 articles a
          week, just so that you have a sense of where things are and what recent things have
          happened (you can find some lists on the course resources page)</p>
          <p>I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://codeburst.io/the-2018-web-developer-roadmap-826b1b806e8d">this example roadmap</a>
and seeing what you'd be interested in learning more about (focus on one thing at a time)</p>

          <h3>Q: When to consider packages, frameworks, and so on: (example) React, Polymer, Angular, Backbone, Vue, etc.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be patient, and take it a day at a time.</li>
            <li>Focus on one thing and learn it well, and focus early on building a strong foundation on web development concepts.</li>
          <li>Projects will come, and most of the time there will be many options to choose from, usually constrained by your team/codebase requirements</li>
          <li>Most companies have their own framework, and you generally aren't required to know it.</li>
          <li>Check out the CSE 154 <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/resources/index.html">resources page</a> for some ideas for diving deeper in different topics in the course</li>

          <h3>Diving into JS Libraries/Frameworks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>* - One of the most commonly-used JS
              libraries with helpful DOM/AJAX/UI functions (fairly easy to learn
              with 154 knowledge, and will make your life a lot easier)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html">TypeScript</a> - Provides types in JS (much easier to
              handle common JS errors)</li>

            <li><a href="http://reactivex.io/rxjs/">Rx.js</a> - Reactive programming in JS (moderately-easy to learn)</li>
            <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> - A popular component-based JS library (moderate difficulty to learn, mostly due to setting it up on your computer)</li>
            <li><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js with Marionette.js</a>* - A JS MVC
              framework (lets you easily create single-page web apps)</li>
            <li><a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>* - Data visualization library for JS
              (moderately-easy to learn)</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Why and how to learn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWjofpeBUU4">PHP in 2019</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/" target="_blank">Python Flask</a> - Another server-side solution for
              web apps, but often integrated with the front-end</li>
            <li>Java, Ruby, ASP, and others are also languages that can be ran on the server, but becoming less common.</li>
            <li>Try to explore more features of Node.js and Express and check out different npm packages - <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">mongodb</a> is a neat alternative to SQL</li>

          <h2>In Conclusion...</h2>
          <p>You've all learned a ton of new languages and technologies</p>
          <p>From here on, you'll be able to "speak the language of web
          development" among friends, co-workers, employers, professors,
          etc.</p>
          <p>Chances are, you'll know material they don't</p>
          <p>Don't be overwhelmed about the world of the web today - there's a
          lot, but patience, practice, and focusing on a particular domain will be most helpful
          to improve as a web developer</p>
