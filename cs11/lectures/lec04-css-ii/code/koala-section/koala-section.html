        Koalas are great. They have fluffy ears and are like teddy bears, only they come
        with a heart <span id="heart">&lt;3</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Koalas live in Australia. They are actually more closely related to the kangaroo than
        bears (they have pouches!). They eat a lot of Eucalyptus plants. They were discovered
        by Europeans over 200 years ago, and there are records of them being called names like
        "koolewong", "colo", "koolah", and "boorabee."
      </p>

        Interestingly, koalas have one of the smallest brains in porportion to their body
        weight. They usually live a solitary life in trees, sleeping up to 18 hours a day.
