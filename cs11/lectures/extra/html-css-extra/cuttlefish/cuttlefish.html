				<p>Cuttlefish are the cutest sea creatures known to humans - baby cuttlefish are perhaps the most heart-melting sights in the sea, with tiny tentacles and adorable curvy eyes.</p>
				<p>Despite their name, they are not actually
				fish. They belong to the group "cephalopods," which includes their close relatives, octopi and squid. Like squid, cuttlefish have 8 arms and two long tentacles used for feeding, and they eat prey with their "beaks". Cuttlefish, along with most cephalopods are known as the "ocean's most intelligent invertebrates."</p>
				<p>How many sea creatures do you know of that have both a shell and fins (not flippers)? A cuttlefish is has both! The shell, or "cuttlebone" of a cuttlefish protects its organs.</p>
				<p>Similar to the octopus, cuttlefish can use camouflage to help blend with the surroundings to hide from predators.</p>
				<p>The "Charlie Brown" eyes of a cuttlefish serve a purpose in their survival - the W-shaped eyelids allow them to see both in front and behind them simultaneously.
